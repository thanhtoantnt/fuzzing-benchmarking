Map (CV/mapping_write.sol#6-25) contract sets array length with a user-controlled value:
	- map.length = key + 1 (CV/mapping_write.sol#12)
Reference: https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#array-length-assignment

Map.owner (CV/mapping_write.sol#7) is never initialized. It is used in:
	- Map.withdraw() (CV/mapping_write.sol#21-24)
Reference: https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#uninitialized-state-variables

Pragma version^0.4.24 (CV/mapping_write.sol#2) allows old versions
solc-0.4.24 is not recommended for deployment
Reference: https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#incorrect-versions-of-solidity

Map.owner (CV/mapping_write.sol#7) should be constant
